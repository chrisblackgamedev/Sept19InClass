In todays lecture we did an in class exercise to create shaders for multiple UV's as well as world reflection. I made several mistakes during this exercise, most prominantly trying to create the shader within a material which caused my code to be undone. I eventually corrected this and got the shaders working as intended. This exercise created a good opportunity to utilize these kind of shaders in future projects. Reflection is especially useful.
